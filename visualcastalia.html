        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The VisualCastalia is an extension of the Castalia, a Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) simulation framework
            based on the OMNet++ simulator. Castalia provides resources for simulations of WSN applications.</p>

        <p>Although many types of simulations can be performed using Castalia, all simulations are based on
            transmissions of scalar data. For transmission of visual data (still images and video streams), Castalia
            does not provide resources to allow realistic simulations of Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN).</p>

        <p>In this context, the VisualCastalia comes as an extension of the original Castalia framework, bringing new
            resources for simulations of image transmissions in wireless sensor networks. The idea is to provide a more
            realistic solution for simulations of such networks.</p>

        <p>This extension was developed in the Laboratory of Multimedia Communications (NetMedia) of the State
            University of Feira de Santana (UEFS), Brazil. It was originally developed by Prof. Dr. Daniel G. Costa and
            Lucas Vinicius Assis, with support of CNPq brazilian research agency.</p>

        <p>The VisualCastalia code is still in its alpha version. It can be found HERE.</p>
        <p>Installation instructions are presented at the end of this page.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="characteristics">
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>

        <p>The VisualCastalia framework is focused on image sensing and transmissions of image packets in WSN. There are
            many relevant issues concerning Wireless Visual Sensor Networks ([1]) that may be simulated to provide
            numerical results for different kinds of performance analysis, as visual sensing coverage, deployment,
            transmission, media coding, compressing, security, among others. In this complex scenario, the
            VisualCastalia extension is focused on image packets transmissions, addressing packet generation and
            transmission.</p>

        <p>The main characteristics of this extension are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Castalia's Node is extended to support image transmissions. Using VisualCastalia, a Node can
                transmit image packets considering a transmission frequency (snapshots per second).</li>

            <li>Image sensing and transmission are centered in a new application, ImageTransmission, which provides many
                parameters for configurations of particular aspects of image sensing and transmissions.</li>

            <li>Users must define the characteristics of visual data and the simulator transforms visual data into data
                packets, which are then transmitted using the resources already provided by Castalia.</li>

            <li>The VisualCastalia transparently handles image sensing and transmission, properly fragmenting images
                into data packets. For that, the payload size of data packets is considered.</li>

            <li>Image generation is done using OpenCV, which is automatically added and configured when installing
                VisualCastalia.</li>

            <li>Images in VisualCastalia may be real or virtual. Real images are created from image files defined during
                simulation, allowing visual verification of data corruption during transmissions. On the other hand,
                virtual images are emulated and their contents are meaningless. Users can choose what kind of image
                generation will be considered.</li>

            <li>VisualCastalia introduces new results:
                <ol>
                    <li>PSNR measure of transmitted and received images</li>
                    <li>End-to-end latency of image sensing/reconstruction and</li>
                    <li>Specific traces for images handling and processing</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>VisualCastalia is focused on packet transmissions and thus some issues of wireless visual sensor networks are
            not addressed by this simulation extension. Field of View of camera-enabled sensor nodes are not modeled in
            Visual Castalia. Coverage metrics are not employed and deployment of visual nodes is not addressed as well.
        </p>

    <section id="design">
        <h2>Design and specification</h2>

        <p>VisualCastalia is based on Castalia framework, version 3.2. In such way, the structure of Castalia was
            carefully considered when defining the VisualCastalia. Actually, many files were inserted but we avoided to
            remove or alter files of original Castalia. Thus, VisualCastalia can be installed transparently for users
            who already have Castalia installed and working. Doing so, we made of VisualCastalia a new extension, and
            not a new simulator.</p>

        <p>All modifications are made in Module Node, as follows [under construction]:</p>

        <img src="http://lara.uefs.br/visualcastalia/VisualCastaliaModules.png" alt="A diagram">

        <p>New files are inserted into the Node module of Castalia, adding new functionalities. The new files of
            VisualCastalia are presented in this class diagram, where configuration parameters and the interaction
            between classes are outlined:</p>

        <img src="http://lara.uefs.br/visualcastalia/classesVCastalia.png" alt="Class Diagram">

        <p>An <kbd>ImageTransmission</kbd> defines an application associated to the defined node. The <kbd>ImageTransmission</kbd> inherents
            from <kbd>VirtualApplication</kbd> class of Castalia, which is required by Castalia. In short, if a <kbd>Node</kbd> uses the
            <kbd>ImageTransmission</kbd> application, it can transmit and receive image packets, turning it into a visual node. Any
            number of nodes of a simulation may use this application, and we may also have different nodes with
            different applications (visual and scalar nodes in the same simulation).</p>

        <p>The new files of ImageTransmission are ImageTransmission.cc e ImageTransmission.h. These files specify the
            basic procedures a visual node implements to transmit image packets. Packet capturing (from OpenCV),
            packetizing, transmission schedule and packet reception are managed by the ImageTransmission. There are many
            parameters in the ImageTransmission, where some of them may be directly configured by users.</p>

        <p>An ImagePacket is used to transmit data of (emulated) sensed images. It inherents from ApplicationPacket of
            Castalia and uses a instance of headerImagePacket to add flexibility and modularity to the solution. Control
            information may be inserted into the headerImagePacket to allow QoS-based processing of data packets, e.g.
            marking packets with priority tags.</p>
        <p>The new file inserted into Castalia is ImagePacket.msg.</p>

        <p>The SinkNodeManager defines the behavior of sink nodes, concerning image processing. It is used to manage the
            reconstruction of received images, saving them in proper directories (specified by users).</p>
        <p>The new file inserted into Castalia are SinkNodeManager.cc and SinkNodeManager.h.</p>

        <p>The ImageManager was designed to support image handling, directly interacting with OpenCV. The ImageHandler
            provides images for the ImageApplication, and performs reconstruction of received images.</p>
        <p>The new file inserted into Castalia are ImageManager.cc and ImageManager.h.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="simulations">
        <h2>Simulations</h2>

        <p>Simulations are performed creating an omenetpp.ini file specifying nodes and configurations. Actually, the
            same
            parameters used for standard Castalia simulation an ben used for VisualCastalia, and some of them are indeed
            mandatory.</p>

        <p>In VisualCastalia, the time for simulation, nodes and protocols definitions are done in the same way of
            standard Castalia simulations. When employing VisualCastalia, the only difference is that some or all sensor
            nodes will use the ImageTransmission application. And, in this case, some basic configurations of that
            application are required.</p>

        <p>All configuration parameters for users are provided by ImageTransmition application. A description for each
            of
            those parameters is presented in the following table:</p>

        <p>An example of part of a omnetpp.ini file is presentes as folows, highlighting configuration of
            ImageTransmission application:</p>

        <img src="http://lara.uefs.br/visualcastalia/simul1.png">

        <p>When VisualCastalia is used, the sink node must use the ImageTransmission application, sinde image reception
            and
            reconstruction is only performed at the sink.</p>

        <p>Here are some omnetpp.ini files previously configured that can be used to test the operation of
            VisualCastalia:</p>

        <p><b>Scenario 1</b>. Two nodes (one source and one sink), with source transmitting 1 image per second: <a
                href="visualcastalia/test1.zip">here</a></p>

        <p><b>Scenario 2</b>. Four nodes (one source and one sink), with static routing and source transmitting at
            different frequencies: <a href="visualcastalia/test2.zip">here</a></p>

        <p><b>Scenario 3</b>. Five nodes, with two sources transmitting through a single multihop path toward the sink
            and assuming different frequencies: <a href="visualcastalia/test3.zip">here</a></p>
    </section>

    <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>VisualCastalia provides some additional results to the ones provided by Castalia. Actually, standard
            CastaliaResults program, presented in Castalia /bin directory, may be used to produce graphics with
            information
            of energy consumption and successful packet reception.</p>

        <p></p>Examples os results of energy consumption for Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are presented as follows:</p>

        <p>Besides results produced by CastaliaResults, we also defined new results for image transmission. A new
            script,
            VisualCastaliaResults, generates results as PSNR and latency.</p>
